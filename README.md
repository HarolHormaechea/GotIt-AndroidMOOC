# GotIt-AndroidMOOC
Got It! Project for Coursera based Android/Spring Specialization


Project as presented for peer review when completing Coursera Mobile Cloud Computing MOOC in February 2016.

It was the first project I did by myself (disregarding my vocational degree assignments) and learnt quite a bit from it. Specially what not to do!
